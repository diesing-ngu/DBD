# Dry bulk density
R scripts for the spatial prediction of dry bulk density (DBD) of surface sediments on the Norwegian continental margin.  
### Model outputs

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted dry bulk densities of the upper 10 cm of the sediment column

* 90% prediction interval, which can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty

* Area of applicability of the model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)
